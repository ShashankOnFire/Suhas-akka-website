            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Hello, I am Lakshmi Prasanna Malneni. I am 18 years old. I am the second of three children. My parents maintain a poultry business to facilitate us three siblings. I have an older sister pursuing medicine back in India and a younger brother
                who just completed high school. I study Bachelor's in Computer Science at Leicester University. I am initially from India and came to Leicester to study for this degree. I love reading books, traveling, and watching movies apart from studying.
                My life in Leicester has been a rollercoaster; now, after a year looking back, it is terrific.</p>
            <h1>Strengths</h1>
            <p>One of my strengths is my ability to blend with others. If one of my partners is having a bad day or simply wants a shoulder to cry on, I am available to help. Although I cannot typically make their problems disappear, simply being there for
                them makes them feel better and more uplifted. I am highly driven and enthusiastic about learning. I am known for finishing projects ahead of schedule, which I believe is especially vital when things are continually changing and evolving.
                I take the initiative and am constantly thinking of new methods to tackle problems without waiting for instructions. I am also always up to date on the current trends and eager to try new things.</p>
            <h1>Motivations</h1>
            <p>Self-motivation is empowering for me, finding something I enjoy and want to do and setting a goal to achieve it. My main goal right now is to complete my degree. Apart from self-motivation, my parents, family, and friends are my key motivators;
                they help me in every step I take and push me harder to achieve my goals and aspirations. They motivate me to be the best version of myself.</p>

            <h1>Functions of Modern Computer</h1>
            <p>The modern computer, the pinnacle of the 21st century, is made to perform four main functions. They include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Data input</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data processing
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Information output</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data and information storage</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <br>
            <div class="data">
                <p>
                    <h1>Data input</h1>
                    Input refers to any information delivered to a computer or a software program. Because the delivered information is also considered data, supplying information to the computer is known as data input. It can be done through various devices, for example,
                    keyboard, mouse, microphone, webcam, etc. The primarily used devices are a keyboard and mouse. The input can also be achieved through secondary storage media and networking interfaces.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h1>Data processing</h1>
                    A computer's primary purpose is data processing. Processing is the manipulation of raw data before it is converted into usable information. Typically, data is in raw form and will be processed before being sent for user consumption. The processing is
                    done by the 'brain' of a computer, also known as a microprocessor (or the CPU or APU). In addition to the microprocessor, dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and static random access memory (SRAM) are essential data processing components.
                    Data provided by input devices is temporarily stored in DRAM before being moved to SRAM, where the CPU manipulates it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h1>Information Output</h1>
                    Output is any information processed by and sent out by a computer. Anything visible on your computer monitor screen, such as the text you write on your keyboard, is an example of the output. Information output can also be anything, including audio files
                    by the use of a speaker, a hard copy output such as onto paper, or even something such as 3D models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h1>Data and information storage</h1>
                    Data and information storage is a computer's last and equally crucial function. Storage systems may rely on electromagnetic, optical, or other media to preserve and recover data. Data can be stored physically on hard drives, disc drives, USB devices,
                    or digitally on the cloud. The crucial thing is ensuring your files are backed up and easily accessible in the event that your systems fail beyond repair. Direct connected storage and network attached storage are the two primary forms
                    of data storage. There are several devices that fall into each of these categories, each with its own set of benefits and drawbacks.</p>
